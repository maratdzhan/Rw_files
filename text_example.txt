This program using for reading and writing from files.
Assumed, that input file has only one "word" at the string, but they're no problem, because iterators, used for reading, is split string to some substring.
Also, the program has some features:
1) the programme can remove substring for the string. For that purpose used "hook"-chars. Example string:
asd.fghjk.l
can be handled with hook-char "." so that it seems like:
asdl
2) Removing strings with non-digits symbols. All the above will be removed while handling this function, except this:
1234567890
3) Removing strings having N vowels. String
qwerty
will no be handled, but the string
qwertyu
wiil be removed.
4) Coping strings array to another template-container with replacing symbols imitating "trim" function: with removing first and last symbols. If the string has 2 symbols or less, the programme will copy the empty string. String like:
qwerty
will be transformed this way:
wert
and saved to the new container.
